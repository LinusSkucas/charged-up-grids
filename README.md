# Charged Up Grids
Shuffleboard plugin for the grids in the 2023 charged up game.

## Building
`./gradlew :example-plugins:chargedupgrids:installPlugin` will build a jar file for the plugin and place it
in the Shuffleboard plugins directory `~/Shuffleboard/plugins`. The jar file can be generated with the `jar` task
if you want to build but not install the plugin.
